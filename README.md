# Jolene
There are many modern inventions and pieces of technology that may simplify your life. A person may also seek to improve the functionality of their daily chores. 
As of right now, Siri, Alex, and Google Assistant are examples of technology that simplifies routine activities. These jobs involve, among others, looking up information on "Wikipedia baseball" and the current date. 
Jolene is a voice assistant model like Alexa and Siri. She is coded in Python and is based on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) which means she can take commands in the common human language. She is capable of telling the time with only one command and many others, and for that one command, one only has to voice the command. She will carry out the request and offer the person the desired outcome.
